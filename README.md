#Freeberg
Freeberg is a webapp that serves to provide users with live stock information at the tip of their fingers. The webapp aims to provide neat graphical comparisons between traded stocks on the stock market and allow the user to track stocks they have in their portfolio.


#Project Ideation 

##User stories
As business students, we want to be able to analyze live data and produce relevant analytics for the many finance projects that we do, and especially - for free.

##Definition of the Problem
While the financial industry has many applications which do financial analytics (e.g. Bloomberg), they are extremely costly and unaffordable for students such as us. The problem occurs when stocks have to be compared between one another and shown in a graphical format.Extracting data from Yahoo Finance individually and across multiple stocks becomes a tedious process as one has to manually extract the data for each stock . 

With these problems in mind, Freeberg aims to resolve these issues by allowing the user to extract this data efficiently and use for the relevant analysis of publicly traded stocks.

##Proposed Features for Minimum Viable Product
* Live Stock Tracker that is able to extract Live data from the relevant websites and parse historical prices into graphical formats - easy access to financial information for user
* Comparison of historical data in graphical format

#Proposed Level of Achievement
We are currently aiming for the `Project: Gemini` achievement. We plan to fulfill the following requirements in order meet this achievement:

* Log in at least 130 hours each
* Build Django framework for our webapp
* Extract Live Data through API
* Application-specific feature extensions - Exporting Graphical Data
* Comparison between multiple models

#Project Timeline
As business students with relatively less exposure to frameworks and coding, we expect to spend a lot more time learning the relevant processes. In view of this, we have structured the timeline for our project as follows:

##Milestone 1
1. Learn important frameworks and modules required to start our project. 
2. Start on homepage 
3. Build basic models required to track stock objects in Django

At this point, we have a solidified our knowledge on HTML/bootstrap and using Django. We have also decided to use ystockquote to parse live data for our webapp. We are currently working on two separate files and have started on our Homepage and the basic models required to track our Stocks. These files may be found on Github 

##Milestone 2
1. Show live data in graphical format
2. Finish Stock Track Page
3. Start working on comparisons

By Milestone 2, we plan to have our stock tracker page up and running. This will include displaying historical prices of stocks in a graphical format. We also hope to have experimented with at least one stock comparison.
